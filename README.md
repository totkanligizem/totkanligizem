Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I am a **Data Scientist** with a strong background in **statistics, machine learning, and data analytics**, experienced in building **end-to-end data workflows** spanning data preparation, exploratory analysis, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.

Alongside my **M.Sc. in Management Information Systems (MIS)**, I completed a comprehensive curriculum combining **core MIS and MBA-level coursework**, covering areas such as Systems Analysis and Design, Business Analytics and Big Data, Value Chain Management, Project Management, and Research Methods. This academic foundation enables me to approach data problems with strong **systems thinking** and a clear understanding of **technology-driven business processes**.

In addition, I completed advanced MBA-level courses including **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**, **Sustainable Management**, **Big Data Management**, and **Low-Code Application Development**, strengthening my ability to integrate **analytics, data systems, and business strategy** into actionable, decision-oriented solutions.

My professional background as a **mathematics and science teacher** has reinforced a structured, analytical, and methodical approach to problem solving, as well as the ability to communicate complex concepts clearly. Long-term engagement with **percussion and drums**, together with **team-based sports such as basketball**, has contributed to strong discipline, focus, and a collaborative working style.

I continuously develop my expertise in **machine learning, deep learning, and applied AI**, with a focus on building **interpretable, scalable, and business-relevant solutions**.
