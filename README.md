Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I am a **Data Scientist** specializing in **machine learning, deep learning, and applied artificial intelligence**, with hands-on experience in designing and delivering **end-to-end data science solutions**—from data ingestion and exploratory analysis (EDA) to modeling, evaluation, deployment, and decision support.

I hold a **Master’s degree in Management Information Systems (MIS)** with MBA-level coursework, enabling me to bridge **data, technology, and business strategy**. My work goes beyond building accurate models; I focus on **interpretability, analytical rigor, and measurable business impact**, ensuring that insights translate into actionable decisions.

My professional background spans **data analysis, business analytics, and project-oriented roles**, where I have worked with diverse, real-world datasets and contributed to data-driven decision-making processes. In parallel, my experience as a **mathematics and science teacher** has strengthened my structured thinking, problem decomposition skills, and ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

I continuously deepen my expertise in **machine learning, deep learning, and AI**, with a particular interest in scalable pipelines, explainable models, and AI-driven decision support systems. I aim to contribute to teams that value **technical depth, analytical clarity, and collaborative problem-solving**.
