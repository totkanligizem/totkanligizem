Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I am a **Data Scientist** focused on **machine learning, deep learning, and applied artificial intelligence**, with experience in building **end-to-end data science workflows** ranging from data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to modeling, evaluation, and visualization.

I hold a **Master’s degree in Management Information Systems (MIS)** with MBA-level coursework, which enables me to integrate **data, technology, and business strategy** when developing analytical and AI-driven solutions. My work goes beyond model building, with a strong emphasis on **analytical rigor, interpretability, and measurable business impact** through decision support systems and KPIs.

My professional background spans **data analysis, business analytics, and project-oriented roles**, where I have worked with diverse datasets and contributed to data-driven decision-making processes. In addition, my experience as a **mathematics and science teacher** has strengthened my structured thinking, analytical discipline, and ability to communicate complex concepts clearly and effectively.

I continuously develop my expertise in **machine learning, deep learning, and AI**, aiming to contribute to teams that value **technical depth, analytical clarity, and collaborative problem-solving**.
