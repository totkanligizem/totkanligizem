Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I am a **Data Scientist** with a strong background in **statistics, machine learning, data analytics, and applied artificial intelligence**, experienced in building **end-to-end data workflows** including data preparation, exploratory analysis, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.

I hold an **M.Sc. in Management Information Systems (MIS)** and completed a comprehensive curriculum combining **core MIS and MBA-level coursework**. My academic training covered areas such as *Fundamentals of Management Information Systems, Systems Analysis and Design, Business Analytics and Big Data, Value Chain Management, and Project Management*, providing a solid foundation in **systems thinking and technology-driven business processes**.

In addition, I completed **MBA-level courses** including *Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Sustainable Management, Business Analytics and Research Methods, Big Data Management, and Low-Code Application Development*. This background strengthens my ability to **integrate analytics, data systems, and business strategy**, and to translate complex business requirements into **data-driven solutions and actionable insights**.

My professional experience as a **mathematics and science teacher** has reinforced a structured, analytical, and systems-oriented approach to problem solving, as well as clear communication of complex concepts. Long-term engagement with **percussion and drums**, together with **team-based sports such as basketball**, has contributed to strong discipline, focus, and a collaborative working style.

I continuously develop my expertise in **machine learning, deep learning, and AI**, aiming to contribute to teams that value **technical depth, analytical clarity, reproducibility, and real-world impact**.
